# Contribute

As you see, Flutter is a framework that helps developer to design UI fastly.

Its Hot Reload feature can shorten debug time greatly, making the process WYSIWYG.

By using PlatformChannel, you can create specific functionalities for different platforms.

This app uses `mobx`, `flutter_bloc` (will be deprecated), `provider` to manage status, and `custompainter` to play ugoira.

If you are a developer, and you're willing to contribute to this project, please don't hesitate to submit a PR!

This app also uses `flutter_intl` to localize. You're welcome to commit translation too.
